# Overview

As a software engineer, I created this classic Pong game to deepen my understanding of game development fundamentals and explore the Python Arcade framework. This project allowed me to practice object-oriented programming principles while building an interactive, real-time application that requires precise timing and user input handling.

The game I developed is a faithful recreation of the iconic Pong experience, featuring two paddles controlled by different players and a ball that bounces between them. Player 1 controls the left paddle using the W and S keys to move up and down, while Player 2 controls the right paddle using the UP and DOWN arrow keys. The objective is simple yet engaging: prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to get it past your opponent's paddle to score points. The ball increases in difficulty as it picks up subtle angle variations based on where it contacts each paddle, creating dynamic and unpredictable gameplay.

My purpose in developing this software was to gain hands-on experience with game physics, collision detection algorithms, and real-time input processing. I wanted to understand how game loops work, how to manage sprite-based graphics, and how to integrate audio feedback to enhance user experience. This project served as an excellent foundation for learning core game development concepts that can be applied to more complex projects in the future.

# Development Environment

For this project, I utilized Visual Studio Code as my primary development environment, taking advantage of its excellent Python extension support and integrated debugging capabilities. The built-in terminal allowed me to easily manage package installations and run the game during development iterations. I also used Git for version control to track my progress and maintain clean code history throughout the development process.
The game is written entirely in Python 3.9, leveraging the Arcade library as the core game framework. Arcade provides a modern, easy-to-learn Python framework for crafting games with 2D graphics and is particularly well-suited for learning game development concepts. The library handles sprite management, collision detection, sound playback, and window management, allowing me to focus on game logic rather than low-level graphics programming. Additionally, I used Python's built-in random module for generating unpredictable ball directions and the math concepts built into Arcade for collision physics calculations.

# Future Work

There are several enhancements I plan to implement to further develop my game programming skills and improve the user experience:

* <strong>AI Opponent System></strong> - Implement a single-player mode with an intelligent computer opponent that uses basic AI algorithms to track and respond to ball movement
* <strong>Progressive Difficulty Levels</strong> - Add multiple difficulty settings that adjust ball speed, paddle responsiveness, and AI intelligence to create varied gameplay experiences  
* <strong>Enhanced Visual Effects</strong> - Incorporate particle effects for ball collisions, paddle trails, and scoring celebrations to create more engaging visual feedback
* <strong>Tournament Mode</strong> - Develop a bracket-style tournament system where players can compete in best-of-series matches with persistent scoring
* <strong>Customization Options</strong> - Allow players to customize paddle colors, ball appearance, and background themes to personalize their gaming experience
* <strong>High Score Persistence</strong> - Implement a save system to track and display historical high scores and player statistics across gaming sessions
* <strong>Background Music Integration</strong> - Add ambient background music and more sophisticated sound effects to enhance the audio experience
* <strong>Network Multiplayer</strong> - Explore implementing online multiplayer functionality to allow remote players to compete against each other
* <strong>Mobile Touch Controls</strong> - Research adapting the control scheme for mobile devices to expand platform compatibility
